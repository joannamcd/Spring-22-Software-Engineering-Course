### Login Infomation ###
The way that our login system works is by cross referencing our database. We check if the user enters a valid credential, and if they do, we redirect them to the correct location.

### Global CSS ###
The globalCSS file also lives here. It controls the common styling that is used throughout our webpages.

### "Locked Pages" ###
Some pages will redirect you to another page if you do not follow the correct path. You will not be able to order without logging in first.
